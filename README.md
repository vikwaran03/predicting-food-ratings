# Predicting food ratings with multiple features

### Framing the model:

The question that my model will be trying to address is the following: <br> 

<center> <i>Can we predict the rating of a food recipe based on features like: <br></i>
    <ul>    
        <li> How long does a recipe take to make? </li>
        <li> Are there a lot of steps that make the recipe complicated? </li>
        <li> Do we need a lot of ingredients? </li>
        <li> How many calories is in a given recipe? </li>
        <li> What are the levels of macronutrients (fats, proteins, and carbohydrates)? </li>
    </ul>   
</center><br>
